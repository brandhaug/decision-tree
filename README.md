### Simple Decision Tree

#### Learning
An agent is learning if it improves its performance on future tasks after making observations
about the world.

The improvements, and the techniques used to make them, depend on four major factors:
* Which component is to be improved.
* What prior knowledge the agent already has.
* What representation is used for the data and the component.
* What feedback is available to learn from



#### Decision Tree
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
